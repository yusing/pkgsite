## pkg.go.dev: a site for discovering Go packages

Pkg.go.dev is a website for discovering and evaluating Go packages and modules.

You can check it out at [https://pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev).

## pkgsite: a documentation server

`pkgsite` program extracts and generates documentation for Go projects.

Example usage:

```
$ go install github.com/yusing/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite@latest
$ cd myproject
$ pkgsite -open .
```

For more information, see the [pkgsite documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/yusing/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite).

## mdxgen: local MDX generator

`mdxgen` generates Fumadocs-friendly MDX files from the local module only.

Example usage:

```
$ go install github.com/yusing/pkgsite/cmd/mdxgen@latest
$ cd myproject
$ mdxgen -src . -out docs
```

Use `-ignoreFile` to apply extra ignore rules on top of `.gitignore`:

```
$ mdxgen -src . -out docs -ignoreFile .mdxgenignore
```
